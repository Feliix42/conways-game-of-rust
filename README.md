# Conway's Game Of Life

This is a small implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in Rust.
It's pretty much WIP at the moment and the code is a mess, but if you're interested: take a look!


## Requirements

This project uses [`pancurses`](https://github.com/ihalila/pancurses) (which uses [ncurses-rs](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs) under the hood) for displaying the game in your terminal. I advice you and especially Mac users to have a look at the [installation instructions](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs#building) for the OSX ncurses library.

## Building
After you've `git clone`d this repository fire up `cargo run` and you're good to go!
